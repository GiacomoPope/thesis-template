\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

The past four years of research have been the highlight of my life and it's because of the space given to me by my supervisor, Thomas Mohaupt. Thank you for welcoming me into the department in Liverpool. For encouraging and motivating my curiosity, and for the endless pool of resources which you have drawn from throughout our time together. Thank you for the freedom you offered to me during our research, and your guidance in producing a body of work I am proud to have been part of. My thanks extend to Jan Gutowski, whom I have had the pleasure of working with for each of my research papers. I feel lucky to have had the opportunity to work with you both and for the problems we have solved together.

My journey to this point has introduced me to some brilliant, kind and intuitive academics. Thank you to Scott and Alex for the hours we spent at whiteboards with stained hands. To Lachlan, who two steps ahead of me, has worn a path I'm still following. To Emiel, Sasha and Tom for making time for friendship during Part III. To Leandro and Vincent, and Rishi and Alex, who were the highlights of the Italian conferences I indulged in.

To my friends in Liverpool, both the students and the staff, who collectively have listened to hours of me talking about my research and who have all helped me get closer to something that feels like understanding. Thank you especially to Jamie who has always joined me for extended coffee breaks talking about maths and physics, but who also carried my life out of a home and into a van with me. Thank you to Caroline who shared an office with me for four years, solving puzzles and crunching through algebra together. Thank you to Dave, whose research was passed to me to continue, and good luck to Max who is picking up the loose ends I'm leaving behind. Thank you also for reading this thesis cover to cover as I wrote it; trying to pass something meaningful to you has been a big motivation while typing this all up. 

Thank you to Louis, who asked for a page but will only get a paragraph. It feels too easy to say thank you for everything you've done as my academic big brother. For making me a better physicist and mathematician, for replying to the thousands of texts while writing this, and for taking the time to proof read each chapter as I finished it. More than these things, I'm most grateful for your unlimited patience in being my friend. For always taking the time to include me and creating a space for us to hang out. Thank you for staying in Liverpool for an extra year to make sure I was ok getting to the finish line. For the 32-bit snares, Overcooked, Mario and Archer marathons, and for getting me out of the house and into a gym to play football. Thank you to Sophie too, for being the best part of Louis and for helping me glue my head back together. It's impossible to imagine my time in Liverpool without your friendship. 

To my friends who balance me. To Tom, Finn and Mike who I love and respect both as family and as artists. For the songs we've written together, the big nature we've waded through and for your empathy and sincerity. To my eggs: Zac, Mike and Cavin, for a friendship at an arm's distance over thousands of miles. To Laurence and Robin, who have been so generous with their time in teaching me whole new areas of maths and science. To the rest of the cr0wn team, for the weekends of puzzles and cryptography. ${\color{white} \mathtt{union\{black\_holes\_and\_supergravity\}}}$

Thank you to my family, who have loved me and supported me in everything I have done. To my Mum, who respected the small voice asking \emph{why} and would take me to the library to read the pages I couldn't; whose intelligence, love and will-power has inspired every decision. To my Dad, who would talk calmly with me as I dropped one project to start another. Who supported me with understanding and with kindness. For introducing me to the music, art and then writing as I have needed it. To my brother Luke, who is the most kind, valued and honest person I know. To my little sister, Willow, who has promised me she will read my thesis and so I'm including this as a reminder.  

Most of all, thank you to Holly, who has supported me in every way, every day. Who told me I would get a position when I thought I never would, and then packed up her house to move with me to Liverpool when I did. Who has filled my life with joy and plants and plants and plants and plants. Who has been my best friend every day and who even after long months of lockdown and fairly obsessive thesis writing, said yes when I asked her to marry me. I love you.
